## AP Data by Teacher and School

Writes PDF Files for each test comparing schools and teacher (Histograms and tables)

Writes PDF files for each teacher (Histograms)

###Requires 2 data sets (the variables names will need to be updated to match your school system)

###roster.csv with the following:

Annual.Annual.School   (School Name)

Schedule.Source.Course.Name (Course Name, first 6 characters must match first 6 of AP Test)

ie (AP CALCULUS to match AP CALCULUS AB)

Staff.Name

###scores.csv

Test.Short.Name

Test.Score.Value

###Notes
  Both Data Files need to be in a long format.  Students will appear on multiple rows if they are in multiple AP classes or have taken multiple AP Tests
  
  Feel free to email if you need assistance or have questions about any of the code.  The most important steps is making sure the course names match the Test.Short.Name and that the data is in a Long format.
